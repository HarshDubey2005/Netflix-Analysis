Project Overview
The Netflix Data Analysis project is designed to:

Create and manage a SQL database for Netflix titles.
Analyze and extract insights from the dataset, such as counting records, identifying unique entries in key columns, and analyzing missing data.
Showcase proficiency in database design, query optimization, and data analysis using SQL.
Database Structure
The project uses a CSV file (titles.csv) which is imported into a SQL database named netflix. The table contains the following columns:

show_id: Unique identifier for each title.
type: Type of content (Movie/TV Show).
title: Title of the show or movie.
director: Director of the content.
cast: Cast involved in the content.
country: Country where the content was produced.
date_added: Date the content was added to Netflix.
release_year: Year the content was released.
rating: Audience rating for the content.
duration: Length of the content (runtime for movies or seasons for TV shows).
listed_in: Categories or genres the content belongs to.
description: Brief summary of the content.
Key SQL Queries
Counting Total Records

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM titles;
Unique Values in Each Column

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT show_id) AS unique_show_ids,
    COUNT(DISTINCT type) AS unique_types,
    COUNT(DISTINCT title) AS unique_titles,
    COUNT(DISTINCT director) AS unique_directors,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cast) AS unique_casts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT country) AS unique_countries,
    COUNT(DISTINCT date_added) AS unique_dates_added,
    COUNT(DISTINCT release_year) AS unique_release_years,
    COUNT(DISTINCT rating) AS unique_ratings,
    COUNT(DISTINCT duration) AS unique_durations,
    COUNT(DISTINCT listed_in) AS unique_listed_in,
    COUNT(DISTINCT description) AS unique_descriptions
FROM titles;
Counting Missing Values

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN director IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_directors,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cast IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_cast,
    SUM(CASE WHEN country IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_country
FROM titles;
Technologies Used
SQL: Structured Query Language for database creation and querying.
MySQL: The database management system used for this project.
CSV: Data format used for storing Netflix title information.
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-data-analysis.git
Open your MySQL client and create the database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE netflix;
USE netflix;
Import the CSV file into your MySQL database as a table.

Run the provided SQL queries in your MySQL client to analyze the data.

Future Improvements
Adding more complex analysis, such as time series analysis of when content was added.
Using SQL joins to combine this dataset with external data for richer insights.
Visualizing query results using Python and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn
